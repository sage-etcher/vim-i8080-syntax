# Intel 8080 ASM Pnemonics Syntax Hightlighting

transforms 8080 assembly files from boring, plain files with no syntax hightlighting, to a wonderfully colourful, syntax highlighted file, as all code should be in this day and age!

## Install

### Vim 8 Plug

Install the vim plugin as a vim v8 plugin

$ as user  
\# as root  

```
$ mkdir -pv ~/.vim/plug/*/start/
$ cd ~/.vim/plug/*/start
$ git clone git@github.com:sage-etcher/vim-i8080-syntax.git

  or

$ git clone https://github.com/sage-etcher/vim-i8080-syntax.git
```


## Example

___Note:___ syntax highlighting automatically applies to all files with extension of `.8080`

### Without the plug-in

This is what 8080 pnemonic'ed code looks like without a custom syntax file.

### Using the plugin

However, if instead we use the supplied custom syntaxing files, we get a much more readable, pretty, and non-eyebleed display =D

Much better!
